Dr. Cheng Cheng-bing berkata, “Pemutaran film ini sangat sukses. Luar biasa! Saya sangat terharu!” Ia mengacungkan jempol dan berkata, “Kami sangat berterima kasih kepada praktisi Falun Gong, The Epoch Times, Sound of Hope, dan media lain yang melaporkan hal ini. Kalian semua berdedikasi dan tidak mementingkan diri sendiri, sungguh luar biasa.”



Cheng Cheng Bing

Beliau berkata, “Kita semua harus belajar semangat ini, bangkit mendukung, dan memiliki keberanian untuk mengungkap kebenaran dan melawan PKT.”

Lebih Banyak Orang Harus Mendukung Film Ini

Setelah anggota Rotary Club, Tsai Han-lin menonton film tersebut, ia berkata, “Saya sangat tersentuh. Saya sangat mengagumi praktisi Falun Gong. Dulu, saya hanya mendengar bahwa mereka dianiaya, tetapi saya tidak tahu mengapa dan tidak dapat memahaminya. Sekarang, saya memahaminya dengan jelas.”



Anggota Rotary Club, Tsai Han-lin

Ia mengatakan bahwa setiap orang harus menjadi relawan untuk mempromosikan film ini, dan setiap orang di Taiwan harus menontonnya, “Meskipun kita tidak dapat menyelamatkan orang-orang yang teraniaya ini, kita harus menjadi relawan, mendukung, dan menyelamatkan mereka. Inilah yang harus kita lakukan.

“Film ini benar-benar dapat menyelamatkan Taiwan, praktisi Falun Gong, diri saya sendiri, anak-anak saya, keluarga, dan teman-teman saya. Saya akan memberi tahu lebih banyak orang tentang film ini. Semua orang harus mendukung film ini.”

Anggota audiens lainnya berkata, “Diskusi ini sukses dan informatif. Apa yang dibicarakan oleh beberapa profesor membantu memotivasi para mahasiswa muda dan anggota audiens untuk menjaga demokrasi, kebebasan, dan hak asasi manusia. Anak saya berkata kepada saya, 'Bu, kirimi saya situs web film State Organs. Saya akan menunjukkannya kepada teman-teman sekelas dan teman-teman saya yang tidak datang. Saya akan membagikannya di grup saya di Facebook sehingga lebih banyak orang dapat menontonnya. Ini sangat penting. Kita harus mengambil inisiatif untuk melindungi negara kita dan menjaga demokrasi, kebebasan, dan hak asasi manusia kita. Setiap orang memiliki tanggung jawab ini.'”

Yu Guan berkata, “Pemutaran dan diskusi berjalan dengan baik.” Ia berkata bahwa temannya membaca berita palsu di media luar negeri minggu lalu, tetapi setelah menonton film tersebut ia memahami kebenaran dan bertanya bagaimana cara belajar Falun Gong.",2025-04-17T08:31:03Z,0

An ex-KGB chief: “In 1987 I worked in… the KGB of the USSR in Moscow… our department recruited the 40 year-old businessman from the USA, Donald Trump, nicknamed ‘Krasnov’.” That’s when Trump starts buying full-page ads attacking NATO. “Putin is doing a great job of outsmarting our country.” He says. Steele report: Russian operatives gathered damaging video evidence of perverted sex acts of presidential candidate in 2013, for blackmail. Mueller said “There were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election.” Trump campaign had more than 140 contacts with Russian operatives, and Trump attempted to obstruct justice at least ten times. Campaign chair lied about then finally admitted to sharing info with Russian spy. Trump, ignoring US intelligence said: “…Putin, he just said it wasn’t Russia. I will say this, I don’t see any reason why it would be.” Secret meeting in Trump Tower with Russkies. Jared attempts to set up secret back channel to Russia in the Russian embassy. Trump to NATO member on prospect of Russian attack on their country “In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.” Trump: “If Putin likes Donald Trump… That’s called an asset…” Yeah, a Russian asset. FBI chief Kash Patel was paid $25,000 to appear in anti-FBI video by Russian backers. “The love in the air, I’ve never seen anything like it” Trump said of January 6 rioters, some of them cop-killers… “Russia if you’re listening…” “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily…” Yes, they own a seditious, treasonous felonious American president. Where do you think all those top secret docs in the bathroom ended up? Anonymous says they have evidence the election was hacked for Trump, using Starlink... Whistleblower at NLRB says 15 minutes after DOGE got busy in NLRB, Russia tried to log in, with DOGE passwords, via Starlink...

Or to put it another way, The corporations were the middlemen that were in France and Italy. We hate them also!! Now the middleman is the USA government. Remember? We still get all the tariffs!! Or to put it another way, the profit is now going to the Chinese factory workers and the USA government and the USA citizen is now buying at 90% off. Everybody wins except for the globalist corporations which was the entire goal! But to say in any way that China is winning because of this is just pure stupidity or more likely knowingly trying to manipulate in favor of China. This is actually a huge win for the USA and the regular people of China. The perspectives on this channel are completely biased in one-sided. And the comments are naive.",2025-04-17T20:43:37Z,1

And gas to get home was down from $3.50 to $2.85 My total grocery bill was down by about 20% from what i was paying in January.  And Southern Co sent my new offer for the 12-month flat bill, which is down from about $150 to $115.  I'm happy with this ""inflation"" so far.

How does this happen?
 
First thing to remember - What makes the US go round – Money (USD global reserve money printing). What makes the world go round – The US. What is US foreign/global policy – tariffs, sanctions & bombs.

What makes the US go round – Money. When US nationals/consumers live above their means (debt exceeds income) and cause a US finical crisis then the US gov prints USD global reserve currency to bail out its “debt rich US nationals”. This USD QE global reserve money printing restores US nationals’ wealth by transferring their debt to the world/global population less the 320 000 000 US nationals.

What makes the world go round – The US - How - When USD liquidity dries up around the world because US nationals/consumers are all tapped out again, the US gov does QE USD money printing which exports US/USD inflation to the rest of the world/global population less 320 000 000 US nationals. This causes the prices of everything in the US to drop as US nationals see a reduction in their cost-of-living expenses while the rest of the world sees a direct increase in their cost-of-living expenses. US nationals/consumers get to transfer their inflationary US debt to the rest of the world/global population less 320 000 000 US nationals.

Fact just like in any country that prints its money to infinity will cause inflation in that country, so does USD global reserve currency money printing cause global inflation.
 
What is US foreign/global policy – tariffs, sanctions & bombs. - The current US/DT gov is trying to plug the US debt hole of USD 37 Trillion (a number with 12 zero`s behind it) by ensuring that the US stops doing more US QE by introducing global austerity. This means the rest of the world/global population less 320 000 000 US nationals must experience a cost-of-living crises culminating in a global depression as the US transfers its debts of USD 37 T plus to the global population. Once again the US will become a WW2 creditor to the world of last resort. This will return the US to its post - WW2 US characterization being a dominant state with much greater share of resources and capabilities than any other.
 
To conclude, US/DT current gov want to make the population of the world outside of the 320 000 000 US nationals/consumers who have all lived above their means and have created this debt of 37T to pay for this US debt and any future debt the US will acquire. Your global cost-of-living crises is just getting started and will result in the great global depression where millions of people will die. 

Soft power - tariffs and sanctions used by the US/DT against a 21st centaury global multipolar system where power is distributed among several major states will be replaced by a US/DT unipolar dominant state with a much greater share of resources and capabilities than any other. Hard power – bombs can also be used against any countries that do not accept US/DT hegemony.",2025-04-17T09:20:28Z,0

1. Don't buy an expensive phone. A new version will come out even before you've finished paying for it. 📱

2. Don't buy an expensive bag. Replicas are scattered everywhere. Only a trained eye will see that it's genuine. 💼

3. Don't buy expensive shoes. You can't walk like a duck trying to keep it from deforming with every use. 👞👞

4. Don't buy expensive clothing. You can't walk around showing the small tag behind your nape. 👔

5. Don't buy an expensive watch. A 100-peso vintage watch online looks good too, and all kinds will tell the same time. ⌚

6. Don't buy expensive undergarments. 
It's not allowed to walk in public wearing only a Victoria's Secret bra and panties. 👙

7. Don't buy expensive cars. It depreciates with every kilometer it runs. Your 1.2 Million-Peso SUV will sell for only 500K. 🚗

8. Don't buy a huge house. Too much space creates distance between family members. They'll grow old and leave anyway. 🏫

9. Always settle for the justified price. You can do more with two for the price of one. 💸

10. Remember that it's not the brand that carries you. It's how you carry the brand. 🗂️

'水货' or '尾单' Grade OEM factory overproduction or made in the same factory with the same materials, by the same artisans from the original design blueprint of the designer brand. You need some local factory connections to get this.

Grade A These are produced with the same materials from the original design blueprint, but in another factory. 

Grade B These are produced using the closest materials available locally using the original design blueprint in another factory.

Grade C this is where a manufacturer completely unaffiliated with the original brand obtains an original item, takes it apart and tries to replicate it in their own factory using local materials with varying degrees of success. 

Make sure you are paying the right price point for the quality product you expect to get.

It never ceases to amaze me how deeply brainwashed the Western population are. First, America tried to ban TikTok only for it to backfire, inadvertently revealing the truth about China’s global influence. Now, Trump’s poorly judged tariffs have exposed yet another western secret. 90% of ""Made in Italy"" luxury fashion items sold for thousands in the West are actually all designed and manufactured in China for  le than 1/5 of the  retail prize, becaue westernes are obsessed by material things.

Thanks to the stupid Trump tariffs, the illusion is crumbling. What was once a £2000 handbag sold in a  London's boutique, could now be bought directly from the factory for $300, stripping away decades of marketing deception. Once again, the West’s attempt to gain an advantage has backfired—while Chinese factories continue to dismantle the myth of Western luxury superiority.",2025-04-16T14:24:34Z,0

China’s economic “miracle” was built on the backs of hundreds of millions of exploited workers, many of them rural migrants stripped of basic rights and forced into grueling, low-wage jobs with little to no social protections. 

Let’s not forget the Chinese state’s relentless use of subsidies, currency manipulation, and outright labor and human rights abuses, including forced labor in Xinjiang and the total suppression of independent unions. 

These are not the tactics of a fair competitor; they’re the desperate moves of a regime willing to trample its own people and the global system for a quick advantage.

So, while American corporations absolutely deserve blame for chasing cheap labor and neglecting their own workers, don’t pretend China “played it smart.” They played it ruthless—at the expense of their own citizens and at the cost of basic human decency.

With over 1.4 billion people, China leads not only in population but also in innovation, infrastructure, and industrial production.

Even while facing internal challenges, the country maintains a surprisingly open stance when it comes to global trade. It exports with freedom and scale, without the elitist protectionist barriers and excessive taxation often seen in Western countries. Chinese manufacturing delivers real value: genuine leather, premium materials, high-end craftsmanship (all at competitive prices).

Idc, China stands firm in its identity, never bowing to pressure from Yankees or lǎowài. A true superpower that knows exactly who it is and where it’s headed.",2025-04-16T12:22:22Z,29

z9or_nYdBe8,UgwlSFB9jl88104B77d4AaABAg,@dalecassleman,"We Canucks need more free and honest trade with China, India, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and the EU, including the UK. We also need to reduce our trade dependence on the USA.

So let's work toward prioritizing these two tasks, as we move forward in a direction that leads away from the tyrannical threats and actions coming from the present US administration in the White House.

America was already great, when Trump started his MAGA campaign. Now it is falling behind economically, while latching onto whoever it can, in an effort to drag them down with America. 

Sadly enough, I gather that the old adage, ""if you can't make it to the top. Then drag everyone else down into the gutter with you"", applies here. America made it the top long ago, and was beyond great. But greedy and power hungry individuals like this present administration, couldn't see the forest for the trees, and lit a match to it.

All one can ask at this point is, ""Who wants Shmores?""  Ps. That wasn't supposed to be funny. It merely points out, that people's hearts tend to wax cold, toward those who have burnt them. So when someone has been severely grieved by another. There is a tendency to make light or fun of it. 

So, to be clear, ""no one is laughing at America. We are laughing because of America."" I wonder, that if Christopher Columbus could have seen the present state of the Union. Would he have chosen to ""miss the boat"" then, rather than leaving it until now, only to happen 533 years later?

One last note, is a warning to ourselves, the nations that Trump is turning America against under the guise of trade tariffs. Let's not hate and ostercize all of those so called ""other countries"" whom the USA has placed erroneous labels on. We should look toward connecting all of the dots that America has omitted because they interfered with their previous plans and ambitions. Which by the way, are vital in drawing the complete picture of what a ""great America"" looked like in the beginning.

Very early in my life, even still as an infant. I found out very fast, that no one likes a bully, and moreso, anyone who breaks or takes away, what's theirs. Trump is presently doing all three of these to every trade partner of the USA. He jokingly braggs on it as being the ""art of the deal. Ha ha ha."" Named after his own book. 

Nobody is laughing!",2025-04-16T09:42:15Z,1

This shows the stupidity of Trump’s trade war against the world. Tariffs are supposed to raise prices so much that production will be reshored. The problem with this is that production of steel in the US will not be possibly in the short or even medium term and then it will cost so much that customers might find it cheaper to buy foreign products and pay the tariffs.

The hard facts:
• U.S. buys $438.9B from China, sells just $143.5B back.
• America is 3X bigger for China than Japan, their next biggest customer.

Trump cut them off. Other countries; India, Vietnam, Bangladesh are gladly stepping in. Chinese factories are shutting down, orders canceled, containers abandoned. Exports are down 90%.

The truth? China bet the farm on the U.S. never pushing back. They lost. America will adapt. China won't.

the ones with cash (buyers) have upper hands in any negotiation.
Threatening your buyers (USA) is a recipe for disaster, especially when you have trade surpluses year after year after year.

When you are targeting on buyer and keeping good trade relationships with some others, you have better chances at winning such wars.
When most of the world think you are unfairly dumping your goods and destroy local manufacturing base, goodluck spanking even a lone buyer.

I don't know if Indians can see China's turmoil in social media for the last week or so, but we in the West do see the devastation.
While Chinese political class - CCP - is showing bravado on media, countless millions chinese are shown scared shitless.

They don't know how they are going to pay mortgages on that highrise flat they are living in, where is their next employment and high costs of shoppinganything.

True, when two mighty giants fight, damage is suffered by both. USA may end up in recession. But at what cost to Chinese depression?

China under Mao had world dominence in mind. Successive leaders followed his pursuit with single focus, without developing back up plan if things didn't go their way.

Miser is going to engulf millions of Chinese in this trade war.

There are orders in factories piled up as foreign orders were cancelled and soon people will be laid off. Their factories are being impacted but they're saving face because to negotiate is a sign of weakness. These Tik Tokers are only trying to shame Americans and Europeans for being scammed by luxury brands into paying high prices for cheaply manufactured goods. They're also insulting you by saying tariff us all you want but you have no choice but to buy our goods as everything is made here including your luxury goods. The aim is to simply get the consumer to purchase from them directly and cut out the luxury brand or any third party. If all was well, they wouldn't use these tactics to persuade customers into purchasing from them directly.  Regardless, the money still goes into making the Chinese economy more robust, while crushing local manufacturers elsewhere. These psychological tactics only work on fools with no loyalty to their own country's long term interests. Don't buy, don't support until they operate fairly. Find alternatives and be wary of some factories in Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia etc  as well because the Chinese are also relocating their factories across Asia eventhough it has caused local manufacturers to shut down and many people to be on the bread line. They do not care how they impact other nations and when other manufacturers in America, Europe and the ASEAN region are forced out of business; it's simply a casualty for their world dominance at any cost.  No one country should dominate manufacturing in almost all sectors while other countries are unable to produce for their own population much less export. It's imbalanced and unfair. Not every country can subsidize their industries and use dark factories to cheat the system like China does.",2025-04-15T21:02:07Z,1

On strengthening European defense and really helping Ukraine well they held conferences in Brussels in Munich and wherever but like all the hypocrites in Europe they will continue to blabber and talk until the world vomits them up and those who talk the most have given the least of all and in Europe businessmen determine what the country should do and not the other way around leaders without a drop of self respect
And there are also countries that have self respect and knew how to answer Trump in a way that only he understands and very well like Canada and China and left Trump in shock not like the Europeans do these are the opposite but what is the situation in Ukraine It is because of the Europeans, if they had provided Ukraine with weapons and ammunition and without restrictions, the Russians would have fled Ukraine long ago, but because of the Europeans, Ukraine suffers and will continue to suffer. Trusting European hypocrisy is like trusting an arsonist who loves fire and there is nothing to trust in the Europeans. They themselves do not know. That is why they have trusted the Americans until today, and in short, Zelensky. We must think differently and wage war with drones, save on soldiers, and train more soldiers to fly drones weighing at least 50 kilograms of explosives. This will be very useful.

Look at how many countries china destroyed and continues to because of its dirty business practices !!

Mocking might massage chinese egos but they are as much to blame as the americans ...because Americans use their financial muscle and chinese ( whom american and European money stood up ) use one country centric supply chain to use and flood every country of the world and destroy their business because of the volume they produce ... both of these need disruption with alternatives and parallel economies for competition and fairness in trade !!",2025-04-15T19:44:08Z,0

First Boeing, everyone in the US knows how Boeing has had parts issues China made of course which fall off and fail etc so who cares
Tik Tok again NO ONE cares  
rare Earths other nations have them as does the US only thing is Processing will have to be created which is fine that creates more jobs in the US as already Trillions being invested in the US, Jobs already created ( nt the pretend numbers like Biden claimed ) but REAL numbers, manufacturing coming back, Businesses being built, inflation decreasing and Prices dropping
MEANWHILE in China, Businesses are closing, manufacturing shit down, people being laid off, Billions of dollars worth of orders cancelled, goods stacking up, scrambling to sell domestically, flooding the domestic market and not enough people to buy it all and it also is collapsing, China's economy slowed and is failing there Communist Government telling them to tighten their belts / 勒紧裤带"" (lē jǐn kùdài) ""tighten your pants belt""
SO China is only hurting themselves and helping the US and UK and others
And let me remind everyone in the 80's US companies along with the UK and others went to China for cheap labor and selling back to the US and UK at HUGE Profits, those same businesses have strived for decades in China why China succeeded and now that tariffs have cut their profits it is not worth the loss to continue to be there, that will bring most back to the Nations they fled and we are already seeing that happen just in a couple months...SO wise up kids and stop the anti American chatter you bought it n yourselves relying on Communists and their stealing and cheating for so long...those days are now ending !!!",2025-04-15T18:11:58Z,0

The fact our VP has even the scantiest of notions that China is 'peasants' should scare the hell out of all of us. China has a dozen cities larger, more modern, more functional and more beautiful than America's flagship NYC. Further, China leads the world in so many forward thinking technologies and has built a formidable military. Trump's wannabe mafia king approach is not going to be pretty for America. We are a declining economic empire as we refuse to evolve our economy away from ""all in"" capitalistic approach. China, if it does not simply roll over us, has the capability to pivot to the rest of the world for it's trading partners and simply deal us out. America today is a flailing nation, losing itself in a late stage capitalism death roll, accelerated by a malignant narcissist in an ether created by our very own relentless national shift in values toward profit, power and possessions. ☹",2025-04-15T17:50:54Z,0

America is ripping every continent , yet winning at the same time. America uses cheap labor to produce around the world. Then imports the same American goods back home. Why would that be considered import instead internally produced products made outside? This methodology skews the reality. That’s the game America has been playing. China kept quiet until now. America’s behavior to always use China as scapegoat will be a deadly this time unless they come very quickly to a realization. There is no real imbalance but a glouton behavior to cheat more to get more free loaded from others. The game of chicken must stop or America will be finished. China is not backing down rightly so. Enough of the bullying and the cheating. Be real, the woo has changed. Everyone must live within its means.",2025-04-15T17:27:00Z,0

 there is enough margin in it for them to be made in the hills of swizerland by well paid people that live healthy lives and get paid more.

More jobs come to Europe. The product becomes more desirable and unique. Win win..

With any luck this whistleblowing by chinese makers will encourage these dedigner companies to pull out of china..

A true quality brand like loro Piana is not touched by chinese hands. The raw material comes from there and that's it.

They're selling these products at ten times their actual cost. These big countries are frauds, looting us left and right—it's a massive expose! From now on, I refuse to buy any branded items. As Sadh Guru wisely said, those who carry logos on their bags and clothing are essentially promoting these companies. It’s as if we’re unwittingly signing up to be walking advertisements! Truly, we have been foolish, aiding them in their deceitful tactics. Intelligent people shouldn't fall for this nonsense; wearing logo brands is just a way to promote those big companies that are profiting off us.

Isn't it ironic that many wealthy people in the U.S. and elsewhere, who often express hatred for China, are completely unaware that their luxury items are made there? What will they do with these overpriced brands when they realize the truth? Will they throw them away and vow never to buy from these deceptive companies again? Meanwhile, those who see value in quality over brand loyalty are out there buying similar products for much less—smart shoppers indeed! 

In today's world, we should prioritize good quality and reasonable prices rather than being swayed by brand names. Let’s shed the unnecessary brand loyalty and focus on what truly matters: value, integrity, and quality. Let us stand together and reject the notion that we need logos to validate our worth.",2025-04-19T14:54:10Z,0

All business owners prioritize on stability, lower supply chain cost and lower skilled labor cost.

But we also need to be clear that Chinese workers are massively underpaid and underaged kids working in sweatshops in China for $4, which is why their economy was so high. Let’s also not forget, some of the bags being shown here are all counterfeit. All you need to do is look at Shenzhen commercial centre mall, and places like Dongguan to see  can see these counterfeit bags everywhere.  

Some (very few) of these big names might have something done in China, but the fabric is real and many other stuff is constructed from different areas around the world. The fake ones you see in China are not real. You can instantly tell by the material used. It looks very similar, but it’s of poor quality and material. 

Now let’s look at this from another angle. So clearly, you can see they can the designs from the company. But why does the Chinese government allow counterfeit bags being sold in China? It’s all because they don’t care for other countries and the companies they do business with. Is this ethical to trade with other countries, only for them to make counterfeit goods and sell them to make their own profits and damage the reputation of other countries? 

So, if they are capable of doing this. Think to yourself? Do you think China cares for other countries? Would they continue with these practices to develop their own economy and destroy others for their own gain? Which countries have developed over the last 20 years, and which have suffered because of the way China does business? They would find every loophole necessary, no matter how illegal it is.  So be careful of who you trade with. Because it’s all going to them. And when it’s too late, it cannot be reversed. Invest in your own entrepreneurs and make a stable world. Don’t always go with the cheapest price. Because your children won’t even have a future, if you continue down this path.  👍

Note. Be careful of Chinese bots here. There are many that pose as foreigners and try to spread propaganda and false information. They do it to make other countries look bad and make China look great. If you want to know more, watch Serpentza videos related to how they try to trick you with their propaganda. 😉",2025-04-17T09:33:34Z,0

B-9kUM7nsUU,Ugy2SMdOSByJGElS1Np4AaABAg,@richardchak696,"Brand is about creating fantasy. When you wear a Chanel dress it is a statement that I have arrived that I can afford $5,000 to $10,000 dresses. It not about the dress.  Yes the design is special but it not about the functionality it's about making a statement. That is marketing segmentation of market. Ultar, High net worth individuals.
All business executives know most luxury brand are not manufactured in thier original country but elsewhere. It more like iphone, design in California, but make & assembly else where. 


Off course the Brand management will never admit it. That the reality. Brand use celebrities to create their image not the functionality of thier products. For example if Chanel dress is 500 dollars not 5,000 than it is no longer a Chanel, because everyone will be wearing one. The value of Chanel would have drop.

Prices is part of marketing strategy. For example Rolls-Royce car can't be cheap if they are cheap they aren't a Rolls-Royce. That the value of branding.",2025-04-17T07:15:34Z,0

How could FOREIGN VISITORS to CHINA be ASSURED that when ENOUGH NUMBER of VISITORS especially AMERICANS have ENTERED CHINA that SUDDENLY the COUNTRY'S IMMIGRATION would not SHUTDOWN TRAPPING all of those VISITORS and LABELED them as SPIES? A PLAYBOOK the CCP knows too well, in order to SWAP INNOCENT RIVAL COUNTRIES' innocent NATIONALS to be ARRESTED / KIDNAPPED in CHINA for EXCHANGE later in a PRISONER SWAP for CHINESE REAL INDUSTRIAL and MILITARY SPIES CAUGHT in those RIVAL COUNTRIES. 

If TRUMP is SQUEEZING every DOLLAR from HIS TARIFFS WAR, CHINA is UNLEASHING every DOLLAR in its PROPAGANDA WAR to CREATE a 'FAKE REALITY' on the TRUE STATE of CHINA lining the POCKETS of MEDIA NETWORKS, BROADCASTERS, JOURNALISTS, COMMENTATORS, VLOGGERS and TROLLS to SPREAD CCP PROPAGANDA.

B-9kUM7nsUU,UgwlzWFivwLj-BeUVIx4AaABAg,@yieldstime431,"As a Chinese person, this is practically an open secret. Due to the extremely fierce competition, China is capable of producing products at various quality tiers with price differences spanning hundreds of times to meet different market demands. OEM manufacturers working for international brands tend to maintain lower profiles - their relatively stable profit margins make them reluctant to publicize how much brands actually profit from their products, as this could strain client relationships. Were it not for Trump's maximum tariffs forcing brands to pressure manufacturers on pricing, these OEMs probably wouldn't have spoken out at all.

When purchasing, caution is essential. Contract manufacturers vary in scale and operate different production lines. The product grade you receive directly correlates with what you pay - similar appearances don't guarantee equivalent quality. Personal connections or trusted on-site inspections are strongly recommended.

The tragic reality is that many Chinese consumers insist on paying 10-20x premiums for ""authentic"" products, sometimes even for designs I consider objectively inferior, solely for that logo. If you prioritize quality over branding, approaching manufacturers directly makes perfect sense. China absolutely can produce world-class goods. Alternatively, consider manufacturers' in-house brands using identical production lines - slightly pricier than unbranded options, but matching OEM quality while often featuring superior designs in my observation.",2025-04-17T03:45:03Z,73

There is a distinct quality difference from luxury brands not all pieces but the ones that are worth it vs the stuff that’s made in China. Now the inexpensive things like the SLG and costume, jewelry, even some of the shoes you can get away with getting from China. 

If you’re just looking for the look, and you don’t care about quality, then go for it. But luxury leather from the heritage brands is different from the genuine leather that they offer in China. The Gucci ophidia pattern has a deeper rich color than the one that they offer in China. Some of the bags that are made in China are identical. I’ve seen dupes from China that are identical. 

The wallet on chain very similar but again different quality leather. They’re going to wear differently. The hardware is different, that’s the worst part is that the hardware from China is just horrible. It always tarnishes it always chips. It looks like it’s glazed on versus actual metal. If you’re OK with those distinct differences, then go for it. But if you really do love quality and you want the bag to last a long time because it’s not a trend and you care about the frequency and vibration of the things that you own because you understand the high-quality materials bring a different type of energy into your life. you’re the real thing even if it’s secondhand

And absolutely none of the Birkins or Kelly’s are made in China. Completely different craftsmanship completely different hardware completely different leather. 

Even the Diora and Fendi dupes completely different quality and materials unless you’re getting something like a canvas or inexpensive material. But the leather will never be the same as the luxury leather.",2025-04-17T03:05:28Z,0

But LVMH is not trying to make the highest quality goods any longer and they are selling more to the middle class and upper middle class while Hermes is selling to the really wealthy. Even if LVMH does not make goods in China, one of their Dior bags was found to be made by Chinese immigrants and cost 58 dollars to produce while selling for about 3,000 dollars. There is a reason that LVMH share price is falling while Hermes is rising.

B-9kUM7nsUU,UgzLUeCK_apHVQ_rFW94AaABAg,@emg5199,"‌What Makes Luxury Goods Tick?‌
‌1. What Are They, Really?‌
Luxury items are ‌stuff you don’t need to survive‌ but desperately want. Their magic lies in walking a tightrope between ‌being super valuable‌ and ‌artificially rare‌. Think of it this way:
Economically, they’re priced sky-high compared to their actual usefulness (like a 10,000handbagthatholdsthesamestuffasa20 one).
The real value? ‌Brand hype‌ and ‌exclusivity‌—not practicality.
‌2. How Brands Play the Game‌
‌""Rarity"" Scam‌: Brands jack up prices to make things feel rare. For example, Tiffany’s yellow diamond necklace jumped 59% in price—not because diamonds got pricier, but because they said it’s rare.
‌Capitalism’s Favorite Cash Machine‌: Modern luxury is all about mass production with a fancy story. They make millions of ""limited edition"" items but charge like they’re one-of-a-kind.
‌3. Social Superpowers‌
‌Classy ID Cards‌: Luxury goods are ‌VIP passes to the cool kids’ club‌. A Rolex watch or Hermès bag screams, ""I’m rich/better than you."" They’re tools to separate the ""haves"" from the ""have-nots.""
‌Power Flexing‌: Flaunting a Gucci belt or Chanel perfume isn’t just about style—it’s social shorthand for ""I deserve respect (and better treatment).""
‌4. Why We Fall for It‌
‌Insecurity Band-Aid‌: Many buy luxury to patch up self-doubt. Big logos (like LV monograms) act as confidence boosters—""If I wear this, people won’t notice I’m faking it.""
‌Selling Fairy Tales‌: Brands feed us stories about ""centuries-old craftsmanship"" or ""royal heritage."" They’re not selling products—they’re selling ‌daydreams of a fancier life‌.
‌5. The Big Debates‌
‌""But Is It Useful?""‌: True luxury used to mean irreplaceable quality (like ancient Chinese silk). Now? A $2,000 ""limited"" T-shirt falls apart after three washes—but the logo lasts forever.
‌""Culture or Con?""‌: Brands claim their goods carry ""deep cultural meaning."" Critics call BS—it’s just marketing to make you feel ""unworthy"" unless you pay up.
‌6. Modern Twists & Traps‌
‌Fake Democracy‌: Luxury brands now target the middle class (""Buy this $500 lipstick—you’re worth it!""). But they still pretend to be exclusive by releasing ""drops"" and ""waitlists.""
‌Sustainability Hypocrisy‌: They preach eco-friendly values but mass-produce in factories, clash with fair-trade ethics, and burn unsold stock to protect ""exclusivity.""
‌The Bottom Line‌
Luxury goods are ‌walking contradictions‌:
‌Money Makers‌: Overpriced status symbols that fuel capitalism.
‌Social Weapons‌: Tools to divide classes and flex power.
‌Emotional Cheat Codes‌: Quick fixes for insecurities and unfulfilled dreams.
‌Marketing Mirage‌: ""Culture"" and ""craftsmanship"" are often just smoke and mirrors.
‌The core recipe?‌
Make something feel rare (even if it’s not).
Mess with people’s heads to keep them paying.
In short: ‌Luxury isn’t about what you buy—it’s about how you’re tricked into wanting it.",2025-04-16T21:14:25Z,0

It would be too easy for these European brands to clap back at these claims by showing us the factories where these handbags are manufactured BUT they won’t because the workers are Chinese migrants 😂,2025-04-16T20:41:36Z,1
